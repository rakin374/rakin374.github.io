                To descibe a human, in a few paragraphs or less, is a difficult and errorprone task. Every human is 
                involved in many parts of the the worldly affairs and exists as a mixture of archetypes. One human can 
                take on the being of siblings, fathers, nurses, geniuses, and more. Sometimes simultaneously. In each of these
                stories/dramas, they are their own character. They may be heros in some, villians in others. They may be moral prophets in one and 
                a criminal in the others.<sup><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SÃ¸ren_Kierkegaard">K</a></sup> Describing everything a person is into a short essay is probably the greatest data reduction 
                problem. There is however good news in this. We humans can start new dramas, impact old ones, and engage in the choices 
                of our life. This is my philosophy to human life.

                This website stands to show a collection of original and learned thoughts, ideas, and interests. I somewhat enjoy the process of studying and have found that 
                sharing the ideas I come across can be benefical both connecting with others and in the learning process itself. I enjoy learning from many different 
                topics preferring an interdisciplinary cirriculumn. Thus, I hope, you will find a wide array of items I have touched upon though real work. 
                Currently, my main study is in the field of computer science. Second to this of this I am eager in to learn physics. As a corollary of these 
                interests I also try to study mathematics whenever I can. After these subjects I would say history and philsophy are subjects I try to sneak 
                in when I get the chance. As a student I will say, the world is filled with many great ideas and it brings me great joy to have moments of understanding.

                I also have a hobby in gardening that I am trying my best to grow. It is a biologically connecting activity both with the enviornment and other human beings. 
                I focus mostly on outdoor; tropical and hearty culture. I hope to share what I have learned in this subject, although producing good work takes a bit of time for me.

                An Important Question of Ethics: How does one become a good person? The defintion of good should contain properties such as moral, all caring, hateless. Being a good human 
                is an important task for those of us who have giftful ability of self-reference. It is something that heavily concerns most of us humans. Learning to be a good person to those 
                around us can be a difficult and painful experience. I don't mean because being good is hard, rather being bad is hard to witness through our own identity. It is my fundamental belief 
                no human wants to cause harm to any other. There is an input of indeterminism through psychological states and other forms of luck, that instead pushes us towards it.  Any how, this subject
                is filled with material of great thinkers that can be consulted. I have included it in this Hello page, to signify its importance to me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I try to think philisophically abot the subjects I learn, but I have come to accept that it is something I cannot control or guarentee. If I manage to find a way to guarentee such states, I will let the world know.
                There is more to think about in this world than I can handle or even have the capacity for. It would be nice to see it all.

                <h3>a short bio</h3>
                <h4>I was originally born in the densely populated city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. There life is hard. People eat with their hands.  </a>
                As I was gaining self-consiousness I moved to the brisk land of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States </a>
                I lived in the small state of Connecticut. If you like pizza, you may have heard of a famous city located there. Connecticut has four seasons
                and people speak a clean dialect of English. For college I moved to the Vienna of America, Boston. Here the favorite color is red. 
                People are calm and friendly. Life is vibrant and different. The drive from my part of Connecticut to 
                Boston is 2 hours and 24 minutes. I wonder where else I'll go. Each location is filled with beautiful gifts. Each place I've been 
                has provided me with great joy, humonously and posthumunously. Last updated 1124.
