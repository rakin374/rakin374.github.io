				Hey, I'm Rakin and welcome to my public codex.
				I am currently working on a masters degree at 
				<a href= "https://www.bu.edu"> Boston University.</a> My program of study is artifical intelligence. 
				Before this, I completed my undergraduate in computer science, also from BU. I am interested in multi modal AI and reasoning
				systems. I am currently working on a musical inteface to help make synthetic music generation . For my general interests in AI follow
				this link.  Aside from AI I like to design. I am particualrly interested in architectural design and hope to study it formally after my current degree finishes. 
				For a understandiing of my education and what I have and wish to study follow this link.

					<h3>Note</h3>
					<br>
					<br> 
					I am working on an updated version of my codex. Right now, you are interacting with this codex
					through a web browser. This is not the optimal way to share across time. The current version was not designed with the semantic web in mind. 
					The update will hopefully bring a smarter codex that's queryable and interactive. I will embed IEML and APL.  
					You can read about the problem here. But it makes it difficult to think in a global sense. 
					All thoughts should be written on a semantically connected text pad. Twitter was a good push at this, but all was
					lost out after @Jack's departure. A revival is underway! Read more about IEML here. 
					
					<br>
					todo: 
					<br>
					create a IMEL-complete text-pad. 
					Enjoy the bugs you come across.
