                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                Eüclidia is an virtual reality application I developed over a course of a few months in 2023. It gave me a bit of hope and challenge. 
                I built the software with the goal of making it easy for multiple people to cowork in their space. I developed the application 
                using Apple's VR software frameworks. The app was built for Apple hardware. I implemented various basic features, but never got to the end of 
                it since eventually writing software alone gets boring. In the age of generative software, I presume it should be easy to take the base 
                source code and modifiy it to fill the requirements I initally was after. 
                and 
                <h3> Motivation </h3>
