				Hey, I'm Rakin and welcome to my public codex.
				I am currently working on a masters degree at 
				<a href= "https://www.bu.edu"> Boston University.</a> My program of study is artificial intelligence. 
				Before this, I completed my BA in CS, also from BU. I am interested in multi modal AI and reasoning
				systems. Currently I am developing a musical interface for synthetic music generation. For my page on artifical neural nets, 
				cognition, etc 
				click <a href="cs.html"> here</a>.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, I like to design. I am working on projects in architectural design and hope to study it formally after my current degree finishes. 
				My goal is to work on methods of design that utilize computation and design spaces with the next generation of human life in mind. For more 
				information about these interests follow this <a href="arx.html"> link.</a>
