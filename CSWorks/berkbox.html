                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The Berkeley Brain is the name I gave to a collection of software and deep-learning based tools for music. 
                The idea is to just use the most current tools to enhance musical exploration, creation, etc. The project was 
                started as a part of CS505 @ BU. The first "feature" of this brain is to be able to learn style from any artist 
                and play piano music in that style. It used a diffusion-based deep learning model. The details can be found in 
                the paper linked. Methods used were off-the-shelf and ad-hoc but demonstrated proof of concept. The fundamental token 
                was color values in an RGB image.</p>

                <p><strong>Project Start:</strong> Fall 2024</p>
                <p><strong>Project End:</strong> Ongoing</p>
