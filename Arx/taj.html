                <p>
                I want to study architecture! As I am completely my masters degree in AI, I'm left wondering what is next for me? 
                Formal schooling is something I actually enjoy and my year away from school has taught me that I want this for a little bit longer. 
                The benefits of a cohort of students, professors, and a collective circulumn are conditions I will never be able to 
                attain after I age out of school. I thought about what I wanted. I could pursue more research and try for a PhD. It seemed cool, 
                but I'm not sure I felt much natural gravity to it. The path seems dark, though maybe speaking to advisors could find 
                a path. But I would have to resonate alot of passion all by myself. Also what would come after the PhD? Cloudly too. Where would I be 
                physcially located? etc? These are details that are important for me. Software engineering is usually focused around city centers. Also what will my work be? 

                I also though about Law school. A legal degree would give me the power to represent people in court, something that will be of value forever. 
                I even tried to study for the LSAT. It was interesting for a bit, but I enjoy it more as a science than a profession. 

                Medical school ruled out for obvious reasons. 

                I eventually found MArch Programs the best fusion. A glove that fit correctly. It blended multiple parts of studies, gives better 
                career prospects, and gives me a vision and a life I can work within and achieve my successes. I still am gambling in the background, 
                but when not a gambler(metaphorically speaking) I would like to be an architect.
