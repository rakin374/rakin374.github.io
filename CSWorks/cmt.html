            <h5>Questions</h5>
            <h6>
                - What is the process of mathematical discovery?
                <br>
                - How these models function
                <br> 
                - What is learning formally? How does the human learn? 
                - What makes the human condition inventive?

            <h6>
                Current resesarch and opinion suggest that language models are now showing 
                emergence properties of mathematical intelligence. These language models are tools which only
                reflect thought hence there is no free wisdom; but we want to understand what it can learn and
                how it does so. LLM/GPT/etc,'s nderstandings of mathematics should be explainable cognitively. 
                <br>
                There is no physical law that contains intelligence to carbon based life. This is widely felt and 
                helt idea. Take the full cosmos into consideration if one has any doubts. What is happening when we study
                math is an important question. What about when we practice math? 

                Thinking about math through the latent space, vs thinking about math we have been doing since childhood.
                e.g. exploring 


                What is precise thinking inside of the brain? What is the brain? What is happening inside the brain? 
                When a thought is moving through the brain. The brain is made up of some structues. If we assign these structures 
                gates, then we should be able to arrange what a cognitive process is. E.g. What happens when we compute math. 

                But a question remains? What is happneing as we imagine? We focus on the latent representations. These latent representaions 
                connect back to an idea. #  Maybe we are much smaller than we think
