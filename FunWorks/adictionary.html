            <ul>
                <li>kibinaire := [noun] ≡ someone who one owns/controls atleast 1K BTC </li>
                <li>turability := [noun] ≡ a  fusion on turing - computability - ability. Other forms: "turable" Defined as the ability to compute anything a Turing machine would be able to.
                    Useful in contexts such as: "sub- turability", "super-turability". ex. sentences: "This machine has super-turability", "There may exist machines that are super-turable", 
                    "Many computer scientists try to design computers with super-turability"
                <li>solarsys := [noun] [dot] ≡ a coded word that can be used to refer to a planet of the solar
                    system
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li> metadatum := singular form of metadata, datum is the singular of data.</li>
                <li> code := my favorite word. very powerful. Many know of it. Few understand it. Carlylyle is part of the latter. 
                    It is espec ially dear to me since its native users are computer scientists. |Super forms: encode(verb), coder(noun). Connections:
