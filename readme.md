#Rakin's Semantic Web

### Attribution: This interface was built using help of generative language models such as ChatGPT. (How else could I have built this?)

# TODO:
- Matrix-Pixel-Index Feature 
- Resume
- Write some articles (I'm tryin!)



Some notes: 
- The index is something I'm working on right now . 
- As far as the interface goes theres alot of open room for what I can do but there are some rough principles I'm trying out. 
- But the Interface work can wait, I rather spend my time working on getting some 
text out. 

We need music! We need something like the Apple Bell.
