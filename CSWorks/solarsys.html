            <h5>Introduction
                <br>
                <p>Space has lots of signals. For example, stuff the jwt looks at. Also think about small satellites looking
                    both up and down. They have tons of signals. These signals have lots of value. In trivial sense they provide 
                    us with imagery. In more complex cases we can use it to map the solar system and predict trajectories. A solar 
                    society is being built, hence a system to map the solar system needs to be built. In this project 
                    we wish to experiment with imagery data to understand how we may approach these larger projects and generate some 
                    more crude but valuable analysis of the solar system. 
                </p>

           
                <br>
                A few programs: 


                given an signal of different rock samples predict rock type. 
                induct 
                given an signal of a solar object, predict its composition. 

                use: useful for solar mining activities

                Do convolutions alone explain and produce the intelligence that see in object detection based CNNs? I 
                particularly have YOLO in mind.
