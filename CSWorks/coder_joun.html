                    APL stands for A Programming Language It's actually a very old language, developed at MIT by a mathematician. 
                    I'm writing this circa 2025, where the imperative programming paradigm is starting to lose it's 
                    monopology. Array based languages have been around for a while, APL is proof, and many functional languages 
                    used it as a model. SOTA consumer applications, now depend on matrix algebra and calculus, and this langugage 
                    makes it too easy to explain these concepts and encode them. APL is that original language. It allows for fast thinking
                    more on ideas of math. All languages are pretty simple, even imperative ones. APL is just in its more bare form. Now all
                    computer scientists, mathematicians, statisticans, and neuroscientists to easily communicate ideas about the brain easily.

                <p>
                This is the newer of the two. This is a pretty big jump. APL, though weird in its syntax and alphabet, isn't changing the way we think or speak. 
                It provides a rawer way of thinking. The array like nature is something most programmers of python have run into, again it's nothing new. It's just a 
                speedy language we "lost". IEML however is a new paradigm of language that builds atop the theory of Noam Chomsky. The purpose is to create a language 
                that contains semantic information.
