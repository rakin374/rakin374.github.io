			Hi!i'm back. But this time I'm a masters dropout. Somehow my dropout feels like my graduation day. 
			Today is April 11th 2025. It's special because it is my Liberation Day. <br>
			They tried to keep me locked up but I managed to get my emancipation papers signed. <br>
			Now I shall help others do the same. <br>
			Because I know how to break my own chain.s.  <br>
			And I know what it feels like to be unethically imprisoned. <br>
			<br>
			Thanks allah, isa, my real & fake families, and the rest of the world for this day. <br>

				Hey, I'm Rakin and welcome to my public codex.
				I am currently working on a masters degree at 
				<a href= "https://www.bu.edu"> Boston University.</a> My program of study is artificial intelligence. 
				Before this, I completed my BA in CS, also from BU. I am interested in multi modal AI and reasoning
				systems. Currently I am developing a musical interface for synthetic music generation. For my page on artifical neural nets, 
				cognition, etc 
				click <a href="cs.html"> here</a>.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, I like to design. I am working on projects in architectural design and hope to study it formally after my current degree finishes. 
				My goal is to work on methods of design that utilize computation and design spaces with the next generation of human life in mind. For more 
				information about these interests follow this <a href="arx.html"> link.</a>

				In the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_(film)">Cars</a> there is a scene where Mcqueen is traveling to Cali "pronto"<br>
				He is being transported in a trailer on America's beautiful highway. He has no friends in that trailer in that moment. <br>
				4 <a href= "https://shop.mattel.com/pages/hot-wheels">Hotwheels</a> ride up and play with the trailer and MACK-just for the sake of fun-. <br>
				One of them plays such a good lullaby MACK falls asleep.  <br>
				... <br>
				Mcqueen wakes up next to Mater. <br>
				He is the most wanted criminal in that town. <br>
