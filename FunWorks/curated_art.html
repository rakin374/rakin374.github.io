							The world is small. Before attending college I didn't give much attention to art. I never really saw the point of it,
							it felt more like an absolute activity. Something done for the sake of it. 
							I was luckily pushed into taking an art history course in my undergrad to fill requirements 
							and roughly halfway through my first art history course in college, I experienced a 
							light-bulb moment and experienced my first artistic sentence. The course I took was Romanticism covering an 
							era of art that occured around the 19th century. 
							<br>
							<br>
								Back to the bulb, my first sentence was brought about from a lofty neoclassical painting: 
							Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville. The painting is perfectly set. Everything about it 
							showcased high fashion and high society, a style Ingres was famous for portraying for many patrons. 
							The painting has lots of expensive materials. The Countess' clothing look reflective, new, and expensive.
							She leans back on a velvet piece of furniture. On it resets various other ornaments and sculputous pieces.
							On her head rests a glamours red bow. Even in the background Ingre places lots of detail 
							on the moldings on the wall, adding texturing details. The whole painting is filled with wealth. 
							This "sentence" or chain of thoughts were roughly along the lines of what I realized halfway through my semester. 
							This painting then connected back to other works of Ingres and painting as a viable and motivating medium of language transfer 
							became present to me.

							A center piece in the MFA Boston. In the second floor of a quiet studyful mueseum, rests this piece. 
							Senior year of college, I took a course in Baroque Arts and one of the assignments was to go to the MFA 
							and write a visual analysis on an artwork. This was the piece I did my essay on. 
							<br>
							<br> 
							This piece touches upon a beautiful part of life. Love. I wrote my visual analysis on the symbolic messages 
							Poussin may have been trying to get at. The piece has motifs of family and relationships. Elements such as the children that surrounding
							the Mars and Venus, the children unarming and playing with Mar's weapons, the hidden woman all the way on the left, and the lifting 
							of Mar's hand towards the mature pair on the right all seem to be sending a message on love. This interpreation doesn't seem 
							all to crazy to me, Poussin was known for making rigorous works that connected to deeper messages, histories, and ideas. See his 
							self portrait to Chantelou as an example. 
							<br>
							Anyways, symbolic anaylsis didn't earn me an A, as I had hoped, but I think that was because of my incorrect answer to the prompt. A visual 
							analysis and a symbolic/representational analysis are not the same.
