            <p>Hi, my name is Rakin Munim and I'm an  (amateur)  computer scientist. I recently obtained my BA in CS from Boston University. I 
				met some amazing people there and was also taught by some amazing professors. 
				I am highly interested in using technology to solve problems and create better standards of existing. I really enjoy working 
				with computers to find patterns in data. 

			</p>
			<p>Currently, I am interested in working on creating intelligent agents, particularly ones that can "see" well. With the so 
				called experts saying AGI is not too far ahead, I think I will live to see intelligent beings that can perform 
				most of the physical labor currently done by humans. Or so I wish.  I also have interests
				in the formals of computer security(e.g. cryptography). I once was close friends with Alice and Bob. 

			
			</p>

			<p>Some computer scientist thoughts: I don't think P = NP, although this is pure conjecture. A computer science course I highly recommend is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation"> Theory of Computation.</a> It akin to studying cosmology and the standard model in physics.</p>

			<p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I occassionaly travel, and I really enjoy gaming, although I am not very good at it.
				I also really like architecture. 
			</p>


            <p>This website was created in April of 2023 to help myself and others. It helps the former by providing me with a place to organize my works and give them a more presentable structure. It helps the latter by providing a great glimpse into my own mind, thoughts, and habits. This site is still a 
				very large work in progress, so please excuse any errors you may find.
