				<h4>

						The    world    is    small.
						
						Before attending college I didn't give much attention to art. I never really saw the point of it,
					it felt more like an absolute activity. Something done for the sake of it. 
					I was luckily pushed into taking an art history course in my undergrad to fill requirements 
					and roughly halfway through my first art history course in college, I experienced a 
					light-bulb moment and experienced my first artistic sentence. The course I took was Romanticism covering an 
					era of art that occured around the 19th century. 
					<br>
					<br>
						Back to the bulb, my first sentence was brought about from a lofty neoclassical painting: 
					Louise de Broglie, Countess d'Haussonville. The painting is perfectly set. Everything about it 
					showcased high fashion and high society, a style Ingres was famous for portraying for many patrons. 
					The painting has lots of expensive materials. The Countess' clothing look reflective, new, and expensive.
					She leans back on a velvet piece of furniture. On it resets various other ornaments and sculputous pieces.
					On her head rests a glamours red bow. Even in the background Ingre places lots of detail 
					on the moldings on the wall, adding texturing details. The whole painting is filled with wealth. 
					This "sentence" or chain of thoughts were roughly along the lines of what I realized halfway through my semester. 
					This painting then connected back to other works of Ingres and painting as a viable and motivating medium of language transfer 
					became present to me.
