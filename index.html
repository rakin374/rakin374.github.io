            <p>Hi, my name is Rakin Munim and I'm an  (amateur)  computer scientist. I am currently working on projects around computer vision, you can find out more about them in the projeects tab. Outside of CS I enjoy learning about physics with a focus around quantum computing, as well as mathematics. I find these subjects to be fascinating since great ideas were created a long while ago, way before 
				their effects could be realized. I find it surprising such works were created during times when humanity didn't have personal computers. I hope to one day learn more about the formals of music. A computer science course I highly recommend is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation"> Theory of Computation.</a> It akin to studying cosmology and the standard model in physics.</p>
			<p>I grew up in the beautiful and charming state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut">Connecticut.</a> Afterwords, I completed my BA in CS from <a href="https://www.bu.edu">Boston University.</a> </p>
            <p>This website was created in April of 2023 to help myself and others. It helps the former by providing me with a place to organize my works and give them a more presentable structure. It helps the latter by providing a great glimpse into my own mind, thoughts, and habits. If thereâ€™s anything on this site that catches your attention please reach out!</p>
			<p>If you've read this far, I owe you an explanation for the painting I have linked above. The current painting is a Romantic piece I was shown in a course in college. I believe it is a patriotic painting. It seems like a vague painting but if you look closely you can see a steam train moving toward the viewer.  </p>
