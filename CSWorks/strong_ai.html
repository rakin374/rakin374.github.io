                Current resesarch and opinion suggest that language models are now showing 
                emergence properties of mathematical intelligence. These language models are tools which only
                reflect thought hence there is no free wisdom; but we want to understand what it can learn and
                how it does so. LLM/GPT/etc,'s nderstandings of mathematics should be explainable cognitively.
